Events are one of the most important parts of a plugin. Of course, that means they
get first class treatment within the framework. First, let's cover some definitions:

> Listener: Something that can act upon an event.

> Event Node: An object that can have an arbitary amount of listeners and children event nodes.

> Global Event Node: The root event node to which all events are propagated and all children are directly/indirectly attached to.

```java
EventNode.global().addListener(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
    final Player player = event.getPlayer();

    player.sendMessage(Component.text("You joined the game!"));
});
```

An event can be manually fired to the global event node by doing:

```java
EventNode.global().fire(new MyCustomEvent());
```

In the above example, you can see that event nodes are able to fire events to only them and their children. This means that you can fine-grain event firing to only the nodes that need it.
Keep in mind, though, that all events from Paper and its predecessors are always fired to the global event node and will always be received by all event nodes, since they are children of the global event node.

All listeners on the global event node and its children will have this event be propagated to them,
and will be able to do something with them.

There is also a builder for events that can be used:

```java
node.addListener(EventListener.builder(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
    event.getPlayer().sendMessage(Component.text("Your health is less than or equal to 15!"));
}).predicate(event -> event.getPlayer().getHealth() <= 15));
```

As you can see, this system is far more powerful than Bukkit's standard event listener system.
