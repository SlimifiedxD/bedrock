Bedrock supports Kotlin in order to make the developer experience feel more native. Features that Bedrock provides for Kotlin
are just convenience over what would take more boilerplate in Java. Below is a showcase of some of the most common utilities:

```kotlin
val Player player = ...
player.sendMessage("<red>Hello, <green>World!".component())
```
