Quartz was designed to ease the pain points of Minecraft plugin development. As of late, the ecosystem
surrounding plugins has gotten more and more convoluted, with this starting when Mojang decided to
incrementally shift towards a data-driven ideology for Minecraft, with API's such as Bukkit and
Spigot staying behind. Paper expoes these new features, but they are usually verbose, redundant,
and unenjoyable to write. That's where Quartz comes in.

Quartz provides neat wrappers around all convoluted parts of plugin development, such as commands,
events, tasks, and much more. Its purpose is for the developer to facilitate their logic, not when
or where it should be executed.
